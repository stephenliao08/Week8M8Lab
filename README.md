2. Feed Recommendation (Chickwts Dataset)


3. Crime Pattern Clustering (USArrests Dataset)


Tools Used
Python, pandas, scikit-learn

PCA, k-NN, K-Means, GMM

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Summary
This lab applies core machine learning workflows across datasets to build practical solutions using classification, recommendations, and clustering.
