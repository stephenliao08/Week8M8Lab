DataVine Analytics Lab
Overview
This project demonstrates how to apply machine learning techniques to solve business problems using classification, recommendation, and clustering. PCA and feature scaling are used to improve performance and interpretability.

Projects
1. Wine Classification
Used k-NN to classify wines based on chemical properties.

Applied PCA to retain 95% variance.

Tuned parameters using GridSearchCV.

Achieved 97% accuracy.

2. Feed Recommendation (Chickwts Dataset)
Standardized weight data.

Applied PCA to reduce to 1 component.

Calculated cosine similarity between feed types.

Recommended similar feeds based on performance.

3. Crime Pattern Clustering (USArrests Dataset)
Selected top 3 crime features.

Applied PCA to reduce to 2 components.

Used K-Means (elbow method) and GMM (BIC) to determine clusters.

Compared results using visualizations.

Tools Used
Python, pandas, scikit-learn

PCA, k-NN, K-Means, GMM

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Summary
This lab applies core machine learning workflows across datasets to build practical solutions using classification, recommendations, and clustering.
